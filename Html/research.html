									From the google photos website I took the style that they are using in their links and buttons and implemented in my website. I used their blue color in my site. Google have their own design language that they call 'Material Design'. Generally, The metaphor of material defines the relationship between space and motion. The idea is that the technology is inspired by paper and ink and is utilized to facilitate creativity and innovation. Surfaces and edges provide familiar visual cues that allow users to quickly understand the technology beyond the physical world. Elements and components such as grids, typography, color, and imagery are not only visually pleasing, but also create a sense of hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Emphasis on different actions and components create a visual guide for users.

									From the w3school's website I took the style that they are using to show the images when clicked on them and implemented in my website as well as it helps in every area for developing my website.What makes a image model unique is that it fades out the rest of the screen so that the user is not distracted by anything in the background. The only thing to look at is the image, so the user can truly focus in the content that they want to see. This type of models can also be used for DOM content and videos. When we have large content. when we want to show content that is larger than the area allotted in our layout, we can use such model. The best items to use in these instances are forms, videos and tables.

									From facebook's website I took the card style that they are using when showing the posts and implemented in my website. The card box design is not particular to facebook only, I have seen same styles in other many sites as well. Basically, the card style seperates the contents in different parts to make it easier to see and read. Card design prevents things from getting messier. It helps to seperate different contents in different cards. This design idea is also inspired by google material design because it uses depth/shadow to create contrast between the background and the foreground content.

									From the twitter website I took the style that they are using in their navigation bar. I made my navigation bar fixed to the top of the screen all the time as in twitter. Fixed navigation is an extremely versatile tool for designers to keep in their arsenal. It is dynamic, it adds another layer of interaction to the desktop experience, and best of all, it is not too difficult to design out. If we have not already, we should try implementing a fixed navigation bar in our next design â€“ they seem to be sticking around for the long time i.e. they are not going out of style any soon.

									From the freelancer website, I took the style that they are using in their forms and implemented in my website. This website uses a clean form style which is easier to read and fill data. This website taught me to never over do css. This website is minimal and focuses on a single color as a dominent color. I implemented the same design idea in my website.
